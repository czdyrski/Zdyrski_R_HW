The two original files are in the original_files folder.

All of the code can be found in the R_Markdown.Rmd file.

If you go to this file and select "Run all", it will create all of the files and plots in a HTML format.

This assignment had me create 40 chromosome files and they can be found on the GitHub repository.

There is a Maize_Files folder containing the 20 maize files (with and without hyphen (-/-)).
There is a Teosinte_Files folder containing the 20 teosinte files (with and without hyphen (-/-)).

Finally, there is a Plots folder containing pdf versions of the six ggplots.
